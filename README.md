Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to parallel programming! Here, you will find a collection of code snippets and examples for parallelizing CPU and GPU computations using various programming languages and frameworks. The techniques aplied here were most learned in parallel programming course at UFRN, from basic parallelism with OpenMP and MPI to more advanced topics like CUDA programming for GPUs. Additionally, very soon i'll be including scripts and instructions for running experiments on a supercomputer.
